Sure! Below is a **Requirement Specification Document** for your **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** with both **Functional** and **Non-Functional Requirements**.

# **Intrusion Detection System (IDS) - Requirement Specification Document**

## **1. Introduction**

This document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for the **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)**. The system is designed to monitor network traffic for suspicious activities and generate alerts for potential security threats. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of use and allows for the detection of suspicious network packets, logging, and the management of sniffing operations.

## **2. Scope**

The IDS will:
- Monitor network traffic using the **Scapy** library.
- Detect suspicious packets based on predefined rules (e.g., packets sent to a specific port).
- Provide a user-friendly GUI built using **Tkinter** to control the system.
- Log suspicious activities to a file and display alerts in real-time.
- Allow the user to start and stop packet sniffing via the GUI.

---

## **3. Functional Requirements**

### **3.1. User Interface (UI)**

- **FR1: System Startup**
  - The system should display a main window with a title “Intrusion Detection System.”
  - The window should show the current status of the IDS (e.g., “IDS Started” or “IDS Stopped”).

- **FR2: Start Sniffing**
  - The system should allow the user to start network sniffing via a **Start IDS** button.
  - Upon clicking the **Start IDS** button, the system should begin capturing network packets in the background.
  - The system should display the status as “IDS Started: Monitoring Network…” on the UI.
  - The system should process packets for a predefined timeout (e.g., 60 seconds).

- **FR3: Stop Sniffing**
  - The system should allow the user to stop the packet sniffing via a **Stop IDS** button.
  - Upon clicking the **Stop IDS** button, the sniffing process should be stopped immediately, and the system should display “IDS Stopped: Monitoring stopped.” on the UI.
  - The **Stop IDS** button should be disabled when sniffing is not active, and the **Start IDS** button should be enabled.

- **FR4: Log Display**
  - The system should display real-time log messages in a **log box**. The log box should show the following:
    - Alerts when suspicious packets are detected (e.g., packets with a specific destination port).
    - System status messages (e.g., “IDS started,” “IDS stopped”).

- **FR5: Inject Fake Test Case**
  - The system should allow the user to inject a **fake test packet** into the sniffing process through the GUI. This will simulate a suspicious packet for testing purposes.

- **FR6: Display Packet Information**
  - The system should display relevant information about suspicious packets in the logs (e.g., source IP, destination IP, source port, destination port, packet summary).

### **3.2. Network Traffic Sniffing and Detection**

- **FR7: Packet Sniffing**
  - The IDS should sniff network traffic using the **Scapy** library.
  - It should be capable of identifying TCP packets with a destination port of `12345` (this is a predefined suspicious port for the purpose of this system).

- **FR8: Alert Generation**
  - Upon detecting a suspicious packet, the IDS should:
    - Log the packet’s details (e.g., source IP, destination port) to a log file (`intrusion_logs.txt`).
    - Display a real-time alert in the log box of the GUI.

- **FR9: Packet Filtering**
  - The IDS should only detect TCP packets with a specific destination port (e.g., `12345` in the default configuration).
  - The system should handle both legitimate and fake packets effectively.

- **FR10: Packet Processing Time**
  - The system should process each sniffed packet in a timely manner to avoid delays in detecting and alerting suspicious activity.

### **3.3. Logging and Reporting**

- **FR11: Log File**
  - The system should log detected suspicious packets into a file named `intrusion_logs.txt`.
  - Each log entry should include timestamp, source IP, destination IP, destination port, and any additional details of the suspicious packet.

- **FR12: Clear Logs**
  - The system should allow the user to clear the log box via a button (optional) without affecting the log file.

## **4. Non-Functional Requirements**

### **4.1. Performance Requirements**

- **NFR1: Real-Time Performance**
  - The IDS should detect and alert on suspicious packets in real-time (i.e., with minimal delay between packet capture and alert generation).
  - The system should be capable of processing packets in the range of **10 to 100 packets per second**.

- **NFR2: Responsiveness**
  - The GUI should remain responsive during the sniffing process, with minimal lag, allowing the user to interact with the system (e.g., clicking buttons) without delay.

- **NFR3: Resource Usage**
  - The IDS should use minimal system resources (CPU and memory) during operation, especially during packet sniffing.

### **4.2. Usability**

- **NFR4: User-Friendly Interface**
  - The GUI should be intuitive and easy to navigate.
  - Buttons should be clearly labeled (e.g., **Start IDS**, **Stop IDS**, **Inject Fake Test Packet**).
  - The status of the system should be clearly visible at all times.

- **NFR5: Error Handling and Notifications**
  - The system should display error messages in case of issues (e.g., errors in sniffing or packet injection).
  - Alerts should be displayed in the log box and should be easy to distinguish from normal log messages.

### **4.3. Compatibility**

- **NFR6: Platform Compatibility**
  - The IDS should work on **Windows** and **Linux** platforms (any environment that supports Python and Scapy).
  - The application should support Python 3.6 or higher.

- **NFR7: Dependencies**
  - The system should depend on the following libraries:
    - **Scapy**: For sniffing network traffic and analyzing packets.
    - **Tkinter**: For creating the GUI.
    - **threading**: For running sniffing in a background thread.

### **4.4. Security**

- **NFR8: Secure Data Handling**
  - The system should not store sensitive data from the network traffic in an insecure manner. For example, it should avoid logging or displaying raw payloads unless necessary.
  
- **NFR9: Logging Security**
  - The log file (`intrusion_logs.txt`) should be created with proper file permissions to prevent unauthorized access or tampering.

### **4.5. Maintainability**

- **NFR10: Code Modularity**
  - The codebase should be modular and well-organized, with clear separation of concerns between the GUI, packet sniffing, and logging functionality.
  
- **NFR11: Documentation**
  - The system should be documented adequately, with comments explaining major parts of the code and instructions for running and modifying the IDS.

## **5. Future Enhancements**

### **5.1. Machine Learning Integration**
- Future versions of the IDS could incorporate machine learning techniques to classify packets based on patterns, detecting more complex types of attacks (e.g., DDoS, SQL injection attempts).

### **5.2. Real-Time Alerts**
- The IDS could send **real-time alerts** (e.g., emails or SMS) when a suspicious packet is detected.

### **5.3. Broader Protocol Support**
- Extend the detection capabilities to support more protocols (e.g., UDP, ICMP) and other types of suspicious activity.

## **6. Conclusion**

This **Requirement Specification Document** provides a comprehensive overview of the functional and non-functional requirements for the **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)**. By following these requirements, the IDS will offer an effective and user-friendly solution for detecting suspicious network activities while ensuring high performance and security.
